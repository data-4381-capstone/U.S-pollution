README: Air Pollution Severity Classification in California
This project aims to classify air pollution severity levels in California based on air quality index (AQI) measurements and associated environmental features, such as ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide levels. Using a dataset of over 200,000 records spanning various counties, cities, and monitoring stations, the project explores pollutant patterns and their impacts on health and the environment.

The workflow includes detailed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis to understand seasonal trends and pollutant correlations. Advanced machine learning models, including Random Forest and XGBoost, are trained to classify air pollution into categories like "Low," "Moderate," "High," and "Very High." To address challenges like class imbalance, techniques such as class weighting, stratified train-test splitting, and hyperparameter tuning are implemented.

Visualizations like line plots, bar charts, and histograms provide insights into pollutant behavior across time and locations, while performance metrics and ROC curves evaluate the model's accuracy. This project not only highlights the potential of predictive analytics in environmental health but also serves as a foundation for actionable insights to mitigate air pollution in California.
